== About me
I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of ECE at UT Austin, advised by [https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/ Prof. Aryan Mokhtari]. 
Before UT, I received a B.E. degree in Electronic Engineering and a B.S. degree in Mathematics both from [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University] in 2020.  

My current research interests lie in convex and non-convex optimization as well as online learning problems. Most recently, I am working on *min-max optimization*, *second-order and higher-order methods*, and *bilevel optimization*.
