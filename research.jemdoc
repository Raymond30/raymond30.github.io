=== Cooperative Diversity in Over-the-Air Computation
[img{432}{216}{Aircomp} photos/relay_aircomp.png]
- Machine learning applications at wireless edge involve collecting 
massive data from edge devices, which can be very costly. 
To tackle this challenge, 
/over-the-air computation/ (AirComp) is a promising solution where many devices transmit 
their message simultaneously to achieve ultra-fast aggregation. However, channel fading 
can severely impair its performance.
- In this project, we incorporate cooperative diversity techniques into AirComp. 
We investigate the power control at source nodes and relay schemes at relay nodes respectively.
Future work focuses on in-depth analysis of the outage behaviors using random matrix theory.

=== Reliable Communication in mmWave Vehicular Network Using Deep Learning
- The mmWave wireless systems face two main challenges: 
    first, mmWave signals are highly sensitive to blockages, which affects the system reliability especially in 
    a dynamic environment; 
    Second, the narrow beam and large antenna arrays can introduce critical beam training overhead. 
    In prior work, a solution based on recurrent neural network is proposed to predict blockage/handoff from previous beam 
    sequences. Also, some authors address the beam selection problem by using machine learning tools with situational 
    awareness.

=== Soft Decoding of BCH Codes
- BCH codes form a powerful class of error-correcting codes that have been widely 
    used in communication and data storage systems. Traditionally, they are effectively decoded with 
    hard-decision decoding algorithms like Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. However, 
    these hard-decision decoders fail to exploit soft information available, limiting their error performance.
- We explore a recently proposed coding scheme that performs iterative soft decoding of binary BCH codes,  
    where a collection of codewords are transformed into a non-binary LDPC codeword. 
    We reproduce the simulation results, and give some interpretations from the perspective of minimum 
    distance.
