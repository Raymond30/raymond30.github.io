<h3>Achieving Cooperative Diversity in Over-the-Air Computation by Relay Selection</h3>
<p><img src="photos/aircomp_relay.png" width="804px" height="306px" alt="Aircomp" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Machine learning applications at wireless edge involve collecting 
massive data from edge devices, which can be very costly. 
To tackle this challenge, 
<i>over-the-air computation</i> (AirComp) is a promising solution where many devices transmit 
their message simultaneously to achieve ultra-fast aggregation. However, channel fading 
can severely impair its performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In this project, we incorporate cooperative diversity techniques into AirComp. 
We first investigate the power control problems and outage performances where there are 
no relays but the fusion center have single or multiple antennas. We propose an antenna 
selection scheme that selects the best antenna for reception. We characterize its outage 
performance and prove the diversity order is equal to the number of receive antennas. 
Motivated by this result above, we develop a relay selection scheme in relay-aided AirComp 
where the &ldquo;best&rdquo; relay is chosen to amplify and forward to the fusion center. We demonstrate 
that this relay selection scheme can also achieve full diversity order and 
enjoy an outage performance 
comparable to AirComp with multiple antennas.</p>

<h3>Reliable Communication in mmWave Vehicular Network Using Deep Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The mmWave wireless systems face two main challenges: 
first, mmWave signals are highly sensitive to blockages, which affects the system reliability especially in 
a dynamic environment; 
Second, the narrow beam and large antenna arrays can introduce critical beam training overhead. 
In prior work, a solution based on recurrent neural network is proposed to predict blockage/handoff from previous beam 
sequences. Also, some authors address the beam selection problem by using machine learning tools with situational 
awareness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In this project, we extend prior work by combining the channel information and situational awareness 
efficiently, and investigate reliable communication with the presence of dynamic blockages. Currently, we have configured Wireless Insite, a ray-tracing simulator, together with SUMO, a traffic simulator, 
to generate training and testing dataset.</p>

<h3>Error Rate of Spectral Algorithms in the Stochastic Block Model</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The stochastic block model is a canonical random graph model for studying clustering and community detection 
algorithms. Spectral algorithms and its variants are simple and proved to achieve exact recovery threshold 
in the logarithmic degree regime.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We pursued a uniform bound on the error rate of spectral algorithms in general settings, especially between 
the weak and exact recovery regimes.</p>

<h3>Soft Decoding of BCH Codes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>BCH codes form a powerful class of error-correcting codes that have been widely 
used in communication and data storage systems. Traditionally, they are effectively decoded with 
hard-decision decoding algorithms like Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. However, 
these hard-decision decoders fail to exploit soft information available, limiting their error performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We explored a recently proposed coding scheme that performs iterative soft decoding of binary BCH codes,  
where a collection of codewords are transformed into a non-binary LDPC codeword. 
We reproduced the simulation results, and tried to give

some interpretations from the perspective of minimum distance.</p>
